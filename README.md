# A Template Repository

This repository is mainly two things:

1. A Template repository, i.e. a repository for templates and
2. A Template repository, i.e. a repository which is a template on how to do things

This very file demonstrates how a Readme should be made in a repository and where it should be placed, that is, in the repository.  
What you just read was the first intro.

## Zero Configuration Startup

Every project should contain this section which should have notes related on how to access, use, run, execute, launch (into deep space) the project. If it's not applicable, the section will say something along the lines of: "This is a template repository, to access it you just need to access it with your eyes, as you are doing. A screen reader will do as well, of course".  

## About 'A Template Repository' 

As any other repository, this repository has a brief about right after the Zero Configuration section. The about explains stuff that you, dearest peruser of the repository, may find useful in your journey, such as why this repository exists (it is a template and also stores templates and templates storage), will it continue to exist (can't guarantee, but perhaps) and whether you can/should contribute to it (feel free to comment on this one but do not edit it yet, please).  

### Subsections (if relevant)

This repository should be relatively understandable without any subsections but, if any subsections are needed, they may go on third level under the about or have their own second level sub-heading after the about is over. Deciding what is worth of a subsection or even a more important subsection is left to the reader.  

## Authentication

This is a written repository and there likely isn't any authentication as such, however this is just an example of something that might be important enough to end up in its own second level heading. Any critical dependencies on external services and stuff that may make or break your ability to work with the repository should be outlined clearly enough here that, after properly reading the README, no big, obvious questions should be left.  
Yes, writing a good readme should be **at least a bit** tiring and keeping it updated should **also be a bit tiring** and also **_very important_**.  

## NEWS

The news section should always be **dead last** and the most recent news should always be **on the very top of it**. Very important, have the dates preceding any title, which is not even mandatory.  

### 2023-05-26 

This is the latest News in the News section and it happens to come out today, the day this news and this readme is being written! YAY!
Any newer news will just go atop of this one, right after the News intro, if there is one.
